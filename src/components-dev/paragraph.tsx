        Back in 2012, I decided to try my hand at creating custom Tumblr themes
        and tumbled head first into the rabbit hole of coding and web
        development. Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of
        building software for an{" "}

        , and a{" "}

        . I most enjoy building software in the sweet spot where design and
        engineering meet — things that look good but are also built well under
        the hood. In my free time, I've also released an{" "}

        that covers everything you need to know to build a web app with the

        When I’m not at the computer, I’m usually rock climbing, reading,
        hanging out with my wife and two cats, or running around Hyrule
